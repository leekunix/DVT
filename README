This is our first open source project that use windows RPC API and open tools such as
x.264 and avc2avi.exe.
I made some kind of embedded directshow filters. One is source filter for elementary stream
decode and the other is renderer filter for data capture.
This project is based on windows directshow filter, so it requires default video decoder filters.

To do list :
  1. rate control
  2. embed the avi mux in the client solution
  3. open gop type support
